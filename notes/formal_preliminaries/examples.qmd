Here are some examples of *proofs* of some basic facts about sets.
 
### First example

Show that $A ⊆ A ∪ B$.

The definition of subset says that this holds if everything in $A$ is also in $A ∪ B$.
The definition of union says that any $x ∈ A ∪ B$ if $x ∈ A$ or $x ∈ B$.
Thus any $x ∈ A$ is such that $x ∈ A ∪ B$, as needed.

### Second example

Let $A, B ⊆ C$, and let's introduce the notation '$¬X$' for $C - X$.

Show that $¬(A ∪ B) ⊆ ¬A ∩ ¬B$.

Assume $x ∈ ¬(A ∪ B)$ (for arbitrary $x$);
then, our goal is show that $x$ *must* be in $¬A ∩ ¬B$.
By definition, $x ∈ C$, but $x ∉ A ∪ B$.
Hence, $x ∉ A$ (or else, we would have that $x ∈ A ∪ B$).
But because, by hypothesis, $x ∈ C$, we now have that $x ∈ ¬A$.
A similar argument applies to $¬B$!
Thus $x ∈ ¬A ∩ ¬B$.
Since $x$ is arbitrary, the argument extends to any element of $¬(A ∪ B)$, as needed to show that the two sets are in a subset relation.
