### Part 1

Taken from @partee_mathematical_1990.

Consider the following sets:

$$S_{1} = \{\{\varnothing\}, \{A\}, A\}$$
$$S_{2} = A$$
$$S_{3} = \{A\}$$
$$S_{4} = \{\{A\}\}$$
$$S_{5} = \{\{A\}, A\}$$
$$S_{6} = \varnothing$$
$$S_{7} = \{\varnothing\}$$
$$S_{8} = \{\{\varnothing\}\}$$
$$S_{9} = \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}$$

- Of the sets $S_{1}$ through $S_{9}$, which are members of $S_{1}$?
- Which are subsets of $S_{1}$?
- Which are members of $S_{9}$?
- Which are subsets of $S_{9}$?
- Which are members of $S_{4}$?
- Which are subsets of $S_{4}$?

### Part 2

Show that $A ∩ B ⊆ A$ for any arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$.

### Part 3

Show that if $A ⊆ B$, then $A = A ∩ B$ for any arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$.
