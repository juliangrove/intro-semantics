To explain these facts, it would be useful to have a systematic account of the meanings of *and* and *or*.
Let's start by providing the sentence-coordinator meanings in terms of some lexical entries.
For each lexical entry, we'll annotate the word itself with a category name, just to keep coordinators of different categories distinct (e.g., we'll call the sentence-level *and* $\textit{and}_{s}$ and the sentence-level *or* $\textit{or}_{s}$).

### Sentence coordinators

Let's start with sentences.

(@ex-and-or-sentences) a. $⟨\textit{and}_{s}, (λa.(λb.a = b = \true))⟩ ⊢ ((s\backslash s)/s)$
	b. $⟨\textit{or}_{s}, (λa.(λb.¬(a = b = \false)))⟩ ⊢ ((s\backslash s)/s)$

### Verb phrase coordinators

What about the versions of *and* and *or* when they coordinate verb phrases?
Well, they should both have the same syntatic category:

$$(((np\backslash s)\backslash(np\backslash s))/(np\backslash s))$$

As a result, they should also both have the following semantic type:

$$((e → t) → ((e → t) → (e → t)))$$

Thus their meanings should each take two arguments in order, where both of these arguments are characteristic functions of sets of entities (functions of type $(e → t)$);
and they should each give back a new characteristic function.
The lexical entries in (@ex-and-or-vps) accomplish this.

(@ex-and-or-vps) a. $⟨\textit{and}_{(np\backslash s)}, (λf.(λg.(λx.f(x) = g(x) = \true)))⟩ ⊢ (((np\backslash s)\backslash(np\backslash s))/(np\backslash s))$
	b. $⟨\textit{or}_{(np\backslash s)}, (λf.(λg.(λx.¬(f(x) = g(x) = \false))))⟩ ⊢ (((np\backslash s)\backslash(np\backslash s))/(np\backslash s))$

### Transitive verb coordinators

What about when *and* and *or* coordinate transitive verbs?
Transitive verbs have the syntactic category $((np\backslash s)/np)$, so *and* and *or* should have the following syntactic category in this case:

$$((((np\backslash s)/np)\backslash((np\backslash s)/np))/((np\backslash s)/np))$$

Using the usual mapping from categories to types, we can see that they should therefore have the following semantic type:

$$((e → (e → t)) → ((e → (e → t)) → (e → (e → t))))$$

Again, their meanings each take two arguments in order, but now both of the arguments are functions of type $(e → (e → t))$---i.e., functions thta take two entities (in order) and give back a truth value.
The lexical entries in (@ex-and-or-tvs) assign them meanings that do this.

(@ex-and-or-tvs) a. $⟨\textit{and}_{((np\backslash s)/np)}, (λf.(λg.(λx.(λy.f(x)(y) = g(x)(y) = \true)))⟩ ⊢ ((((np\backslash s)/np)\backslash((np\backslash s)/np))/((np\backslash s)/np))$
	b. $⟨\textit{or}_{((np\backslash s)/np)}, (λf.(λg.(λx.(λy.¬(f(x) = g(x) = \false)))))⟩ ⊢ ((((np\backslash s)/np)\backslash((np\backslash s)/np))/((np\backslash s)/np))$
