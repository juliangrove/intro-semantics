The central technical notion that we'll rely on in this course is that of a model.
A model is, in short, a way of associating the most basic expressions of whatever language we are studying with meanings.
It can be useful to think of a model as encoding a *way that things could be*, or---in the parlance of possible world semantics---a *possible world*.
For example, if we're assigning meanings to a language that has the verb *runs* as one of its basic expressions, then we might associate this verb with a set---specifically, the set of people (or other entities) that run.
In one model, Jo and Bo might be the ones who run (so that the set of people who run is $\{\ct{j}, \ct{b}\}$);
in another, Bo and Mo ($\{\ct{b}, \ct{m}\}$);
in yet another, nobody runs ($\varnothing$);
and so on.
