What we would like to do is figure out a way of associating elements of $L_{ANA}$ with *meanings*.
In order to do this, we have to make use of a *model*---that is, one of the things that we introduced [here](overview.html).

Which model, exactly, should we be using to *interpret* $L_{ANA}$?
We'll follow the standard way of doing things and say that the model of $L_{ANA}$ is the one defined in (@ex-ana-model), which has as its domain the set $ℕ$ of natural numbers.

(@ex-ana-model) $\mathcal{M}_{ANA} = ⟨ℕ, \{\True, \False\}, I_{ANA}⟩$

That is, $D$ is defined to be $ℕ$---i.e., the set $\{0, 1, 2, ...\}$.

What can we say about the model's interpretation function, $I_{ANA}$?
Well, because we defined $atom$ ([here](ana_syntax.html)) to be the set $\{⌜0⌝, ..., ⌜9⌝\}$, we know that this set is the *domain* of $I_{ANA}$:
it is the job of the model's interpretation function to map things from this set onto interpretations of some kind.
Meanwhile, we'll choose the *codomain* of $I_{ANA}$, to be $ℕ$:
the interpretation of any of the symbols $⌜0⌝$ through $⌜9⌝$ is just a natural number!

More specifically, here's how we'll interpret the symbols in $atom$.

(@ex-ana_atom_interp) $I_{ANA} : atom → ℕ$ <br><br> 
	$I_{ANA}(⌜0⌝) = 0$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜1⌝) = 1$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜2⌝) = 2$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜3⌝) = 3$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜4⌝) = 4$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜5⌝) = 5$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜6⌝) = 6$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜7⌝) = 7$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜8⌝) = 8$ <br>
	$I_{ANA}(⌜9⌝) = 9$ <br>

Hopefully, none of these choices is particularly surprising!
Still, it's important to point out that---while it looks a bit like we are using the interpretation function to simply "remove the corner brackets ($⌜, ⌝$)"---that's just a result of the fact that we are employing the very language that we are interpreting as part of our *metalanguage*.^[
	Recall that our metalanguage is just the language that we're using to conduct Introduction to Semantics (LIN4803/LIN6804).
	It consists of our natural language idiolects (as spoken and written) and a little bit of set-theoretic notation.
	I'm assuming our idiolects (as written) make Arabic numeral arithmetic available.
]
Said one more time and in another way:
there is nothing special about the symbol $⌜1⌝$ that makes it a particularly good candidate for being mapped onto the number 1.
The choice reflects how we *use* the language $L_{ANA}$, but it is arbitrary nonetheless---a genuine Lewis-style convention.

Alright.
The time has come to define our interpretation function (or "interpretation brackets", "denotation function", what have you) $⟦·⟧_{\mathcal{M}}$ over the entirety of $L_{ANA}$.
We will show how to do this using two different presentations.

### Rules in English

On the first presentation, we'll append additional clauses to the syntactic rules that were stated [here](ana_syntax.html).
This presentation is given in (@ex-ana-semantics).

(@ex-ana-semantics) 1. $atom = \{⌜0⌝, ..., ⌜9⌝\}$, and for any $x ∈ atom$, $⟦x⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} = I_{ANA}(x)$.
	2. $atom ⊆ n$.
	3. If $x, y ∈ n$, then $x^{⌢}y ∈ n$, and $⟦x^{⌢}y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} = ⟦x⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} * 10^{length(y)} + ⟦y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}}$.
	4. $n ⊆ np$.
	5. If $x, y ∈ np$, then $⌜(⌝^{⌢}x^{⌢}⌜+⌝^{⌢}y^{⌢}⌜)⌝, ⌜(⌝^{⌢}x^{⌢}⌜×⌝^{⌢}y^{⌢}⌜)⌝ ∈ np$, and also:
		
	- $⟦⌜(⌝^{⌢}x^{⌢}⌜+⌝^{⌢}y^{⌢}⌜)⌝⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} =⟦x⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} + ⟦y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}}$
	- $⟦⌜(⌝^{⌢}x^{⌢}⌜×⌝^{⌢}y^{⌢}⌜)⌝⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} =⟦x⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} * ⟦y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}}$
	6. If $x, y ∈ np$, then $x^{⌢}⌜{=}⌝^{⌢}y ∈ s$, and $⟦x^{⌢}⌜{=}⌝^{⌢}y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} = \True$ if $⟦x⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}}$ and $⟦y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}}$ are the same number;
		otherwise, $⟦x^{⌢}⌜{=}⌝^{⌢}y⟧_{\mathcal{M}_{ANA}} = \False$.
	7. Closure clause:
		nothing else is in $n$, $np$, or $s$.

Note that we are using quite a lot of mathematical notation in the metalanguage!
That's fine---there is no point in pretending that we don't know how to add and multiply, etc.
One thing to note is the use of the function called '$length$'.
This is a function that maps *numerals* onto *natural numbers*---coincidentally, just like the interpretation function!
That is:

(@ex-length-function) $length : n → ℕ$

But of course, it does not behave like the interpretation function at all.
For instance, the $length(⌜12⌝)$ is not $12$---it is $2$!

### Rules as proof constructors

On the second presentation, we'll present the *exact same collection of rules*, but using a slightly different notation.
Rather than writing out each rule in English, we'll encode it as a kind of rule for constructing *proofs*.
Here, each proof is just a proof that some string in $L_{ANA}$ has a particular *category*, as well as a particular *interpretation*.
