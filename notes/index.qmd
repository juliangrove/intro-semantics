Welcome to Intro to Semantics!^[Listed as both LIN4803 and LIN6804 at [one.uf.edu](https://one.uf.edu/).]

I'm [Julian Grove](https://juliangrove.github.io/) - I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Linguistics Department](https://lin.ufl.edu/) (where this course is offered).

Here is my contact info:

- Office: 4015 Turlington
- Phone: (352) 294-7456
- Email: first name dot last name at ufl dot edu
- Office hours: TBD and by appointment

Check out the [About](/about.html) page for more info about me and this site.

Here are some facts about this course:

- It takes place in [Matherly](https://campusmap.ufl.edu/#/index/0406) 0013.
- It happens on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- It runs from 12:50pm - 1:40pm.

## Bird's-eye view

The goals of this course are to acquaint you with the study of meaning in natural language;
specifically, to equip you with a certain vocabulary of concepts, as well as a certain collection of theoretical and methodological tools.
This vocabulary and these tools will allow you to:

- collect linguistic data and determine whether and how it is relevant to meaning;
- formulate and test hypotheses and theoretical claims about linguistic meaning; and
- approach questions about how linguistic meaning is situated within the broader scientific study of natural language and the human mind.

The first few weeks of the course will be more-or-less stage setting.
Natural language semantics is a young field whose basic aims and guiding principles are somewhat in flux;
so it will be useful to have this part of the course be dedicated to making these aims and principles fairly explicit.
After these introductory weeks, we will get deep into the practice of doing semantics by focusing on a variety of empirical phenomena.
The main acts will be verbs and their arguments, coordination, modification, anaphora, and quantification.

## Attendance and class participation

Come to class!
Attendance won't be graded, but you're likely to do better in the course if you come than if you don't.

When you're here, participate!
You'll get more out of the class if you do, and it'll be more fun.

## Assignments and grading

### Grading

Your work in this course will consist of [nine (9) short written assignments]{.underline}---sometimes based on assigned readings---as well as an [in-person final exam]{.underline}.
Each written assignments will be a collection of responses to questions:
some of these responses will have a mini-essay format, and some will be more like answers to problem sets (it'll be clear in any given case what the expectation is).
Each assignment will be available on this site, at the end of the set of notes to which the assignment corresponds.
Please turn in a physical copy of your responses at the beginning of the class on which the assignment is due.

The written assignments will be graded on a 5-point scale, using the following rubric:

- 5: you thoroughly engage with each question on the assignment.
  This means that you justify each of your responses, as well point out its implications, if appropriate.
  For example, if the truth of your response is likely to have any unintuitive consequences, you should note and explain these.
  Doing this well will sometimes be challenging and require you to think a lot.
  
  If the assignment has questions requiring the application of analytical techniques that we have introduced in the course, "thorough engagement", for current purposes, means applying these techniques in the right way.
- 4: you thoroughly engage with most, but not all, of the questions.
- 3: you thoroughly engage with only a small part of the assignment and give shallow or cursory answers to most of it.
- 2: you give shallow or cursory answers to all of the questions on the assignment.
- 1: you barely do the assignment.
- 0: you don't even barely do the assignment.

The written assignments will account for 90% of your grade, and the final exam, for 10%.
The final will take place from 10am-12pm on December 10th (place TBD).
It will be formatted similarly to the assignments.

The following grading scale will be used to determine course grades:

|                  |                  |                  |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 93.5 ≤ A ≤ 100   | 89.5 ≤ A- < 93.5 |                  |
| 86.5 ≤ B+ < 89.5 | 83.5 ≤ B < 86.5  | 79.5 ≤ B- < 83.5 |
| 76.5 ≤ C+ < 79.5 | 74.5 ≤ C < 76.5  | 69.5 ≤ C < 74.5  |

### Missed or late work

Late work will not be accepted unless you've arranged with me beforehand.
If you need an extension, ask for one---just do it prior to the due date.
No extra credit, sorry.

## Zulip

There is a Zulip site for this course at [uf-semantics-2025.zulipchat.com](https://uf-semantics-2025.zulipchat.com/).
We'll use it to host discussions of the course material.
You can post (and answer!) questions there.
I will chime in, as well.

## University Honesty Policy

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, "We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code."
On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied:
"On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment."
