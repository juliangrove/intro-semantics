	abstract = {This book revives the study of conventional implicatures in natural language semantics. The label ‘conventional implicature’ dates back to H. Paul Grice’s early work on the foundations of linguistic semantics and pragmatics. Since its introduction, it has seen many diverse applications, but it has never enjoyed a stable place in linguistic theory. This book seeks to change that. Grice’s original discussion is used as a key into two presently understudied areas of natural language: supplements (appositives, parentheticals, utterance modifiers) and expressives (epithets, honorifics). The account of both depends on a multidimensional theory in which individual sentences can express more than one independent meaning. The theory is logically and intuitively compositional, and it minimally extends a familiar kind of intensional logic, thereby providing an adaptable tool for general semantic analysis. The result is a linguistic theory that is accessible not only to linguists of all stripes, but also to philosophers of language, logicians, and computer scientists who have linguistic applications in mind.},

Methodology boxes are included in each chapter. Each chapter is built around one or more worked examples to demonstrate the main idea of the chapter. Covers the fundamental algorithms of various fields, whether originally proposed for spoken or written language to demonstrate how the same algorithm can be used for speech recognition and word-sense disambiguation. Emphasis on web and other practical applications. Emphasis on scientific evaluation. Useful as a reference for professionals in any of the areas of speech and language processing.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

	abstract = {In a recent article (‘ChatGPT is bullshit’), the authors argue that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT generate bullshit—a philosophical term coined by philosopher Harry Frankfurt that picks out convincing, but truth-insensitive content. The authors argue LLMs like ChatGPT are bullshitting machines. Here I defend a complementary account of why LLMs like ChatGPT produce bullshit: LLMs like ChatGPT are bullshit (partly) because people are bullshitters. Given that LLMs like ChatGPT predict and generate text based on large quantities of data from human language users, LLMs like ChatGPT would naturally reflect that fact—bullshit in, bullshit out. This paper then explores the incentives for people to bullshit—to manage reputations, to signal their intelligence, and to participate in the marketplace for bullshit—along with why such incentives will likely motivate people to use LLMs like ChatGPT to better bullshit each other.},

	abstract = {In The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, adjectives are characterized as expressions “that alter, clarify, or adjust the meaning contributions of nouns,” in order to allow 
for the expression of “ﬁner gradations of meaning” than are possible through the use 
of nouns alone (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, p. 526). At a general level, adjectives 
gain this capability in virtue of two main characteristics, one of which is semantic and 
one of which is syntactic. On the semantic side, they introduce properties. (Whether 
they actually denote properties is a question we will address in detail below.) On the 
syntactic side, they are able to function as modiﬁers, and so may (with some restrictions) combine recursively with nouns. The result of this combination is a new property 
which is typically (though not always) true of a subset of the entities that the original 
properties are true of, thereby providing a “ﬁner gradation of meaning” than is possible 
using the noun alone. This simple picture hides many important and interesting complexities, however, which provide insights on several topics of central interest to both 
linguists and philosophers, including: vagueness, contextualism, relativism, compositionality, and the semantic analysis of signiﬁcant phenomena such as modality. I begin 
with an examination of the distributional properties of adjectives, then summarize the 
most prominent analyses of their meanings, and ﬁnally conclude with a look at some 
of the roles that adjectives have played in reasoning about the issues and phenomena 
mentioned above.},
