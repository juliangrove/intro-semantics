	abstract = {This self-contained introduction to natural language semantics addresses the major theoretical questions in the field. The authors introduce the systematic study of linguistic meaning through a sequence of formal tools and their linguistic applications. Starting with propositional connectives and truth conditions, the book moves to quantification and binding, intensionality and tense, and so on. To set their approach in a broader perspective, the authors also explore the interaction of meaning with context and use (the semantics-pragmatics interface) and address some of the foundational questions, especially in connection with cognition in general. They also introduce a few of the most accessible and interesting ideas from recent research to give the reader a bit of the flavor of current work in semantics. The organization of this new edition is modular; after the introductory chapters, the remaining material can be covered in flexible order. The book presupposes no background in formal logic (an appendix introduces the basic notions of set theory) and only a minimal acquaintance with linguistics. This edition includes a substantial amount of completely new material and has been not only updated but redesigned throughout to enhance its user-friendliness.},

	abstract = {This book revives the study of conventional implicatures in natural language semantics. The label ‘conventional implicature’ dates back to H. Paul Grice’s early work on the foundations of linguistic semantics and pragmatics. Since its introduction, it has seen many diverse applications, but it has never enjoyed a stable place in linguistic theory. This book seeks to change that. Grice’s original discussion is used as a key into two presently understudied areas of natural language: supplements (appositives, parentheticals, utterance modifiers) and expressives (epithets, honorifics). The account of both depends on a multidimensional theory in which individual sentences can express more than one independent meaning. The theory is logically and intuitively compositional, and it minimally extends a familiar kind of intensional logic, thereby providing an adaptable tool for general semantic analysis. The result is a linguistic theory that is accessible not only to linguists of all stripes, but also to philosophers of language, logicians, and computer scientists who have linguistic applications in mind.},

	abstract = {A framework for pragmatic analysis is proposed which treats discourse as a game, with context as a scoreboard organized around the questions under discussion by the interlocutors. The framework is intended to be coordinated with a dynamic compositional semantics. Accordingly, the context of utterance is modeled as a tuple of different types of information, and the questions therein — modeled, as is usual in formal semantics, as alternative sets of propositions — constrain the felicitous flow of discourse. A requirement of Relevance is satisfied by an utterance (whether an assertion, a question or a suggestion) iff it addresses the question under discussion. Finally, it is argued that the prosodic focus of an utterance canonically serves to reflect the question under discussion (at least in English), placing additional constraints on felicity in context.

We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

Given that LLMs like ChatGPT predict and generate text based on large quantities of data from human language users, LLMs like ChatGPT would naturally reflect that fact—bullshit in, bullshit out. This paper then explores the incentives for people to bullshit—to manage reputations, to signal their intelligence, and to participate in the marketplace for bullshit—along with why such incentives will likely motivate people to use LLMs like ChatGPT to better bullshit each other.},

	abstract = {In The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, adjectives are characterized as expressions “that alter, clarify, or adjust the meaning contributions of nouns,” in order to allow 
for the expression of “ﬁner gradations of meaning” than are possible through the use 
of nouns alone (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, p. 526). At a general level, adjectives 
gain this capability in virtue of two main characteristics, one of which is semantic and 
one of which is syntactic. On the semantic side, they introduce properties. (Whether 
they actually denote properties is a question we will address in detail below.) On the 
syntactic side, they are able to function as modiﬁers, and so may (with some restrictions) combine recursively with nouns. The result of this combination is a new property 
which is typically (though not always) true of a subset of the entities that the original 
properties are true of, thereby providing a “ﬁner gradation of meaning” than is possible 
using the noun alone. This simple picture hides many important and interesting complexities, however, which provide insights on several topics of central interest to both 
linguists and philosophers, including: vagueness, contextualism, relativism, compositionality, and the semantic analysis of signiﬁcant phenomena such as modality. I begin 
with an examination of the distributional properties of adjectives, then summarize the 
most prominent analyses of their meanings, and ﬁnally conclude with a look at some 
of the roles that adjectives have played in reasoning about the issues and phenomena 
mentioned above.},

show displacement behaviors, i.e., nonveridicality; (iii) like modals, they

	abstract = {In addition to the so-called 'factive' verbs, which presuppose the truth of their complement sentence, a number of other interesting classes of verbs take sentential complements. 'Implicative' verbs, such as manage, also involve presuppositions, although in a different way. An asserted main sentence with one of these verbs as predicate commits the speaker to an implied proposition which consists of the complement sentence as augmented by the tense and other modifiers of the main sentence. Questioning a sentence with an implicative predicate amounts to questioning that implied proposition. According to the proposed analysis, an implicative main verb carries a presupposition of some necessary and sufficient condition which alone determines whether the event described in the complement took place. The main sentence can be looked upon as a statement about whether this decisive condition is fulfilled, and under what spatial and temporal circumstances. From an affirmative assertion, it can legitimately be inferred that the implied proposition is asserted to be true; from a negative assertion, that it is asserted to be false.},

	abstract = {While factive belief reports (x knows p) are said to presuppose p, Holton (2017) suggests that no language shows the opposite: there appear to be no CONTRAFACTIVE belief verbs presupposing not-p. Recent work seeks to explain why not. In this squib, I suggest that a contrafactive could be defined in two different ways: (i) it could require not-p (i.e., that all worlds in the Context Set are not-p worlds); or (ii) it could require that the Common Ground is compatible with not-p (i.e., that some worlds in the Context Set are not-p worlds). So far no verb of type (i) has been demonstrated, but those of type (ii) arguably do exist -- for example, Mandarin yıwei, analyzed by Glass (2023). Refining the typology of (un)attested belief verbs, the question of “Why are there no contrafactives?” becomes: “Why are there belief verbs requiring that p is or is not Common Ground, but none requiring that not-p is Common Ground?”
