# Diagnosing inferences

## Types of inference

::: {.nonincremental}
- entailment
- conversational implicature
- presupposition
- conventional implicature
:::

---

## From last time

|                 | entailment | conv. impl. | presupposition   |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **between**     | sentences  | utterances  | expr. + sentence |
| **defeasible?** | no         | yes         | no               |

## Things to address

- Difference between entailment and presupposition.
- Conventional implicature versus the others inference types.

---

## Entailment vs. presupposition

First pass:

- Presuppositions encode background information, needed to make sense of some expression.
  - Express what must already be in the common ground [@stalnaker_assertion_1978].
- Entailments encode information about what is said.
  - Express information, e.g., which is being added to the common ground.

## The negation test

Second pass:

- Presuppositions **project**, whereas entailments do not.

(@ex-believe-love) a. Jo demonstrated that she's good at Go. <br>
	b. Jo loves that she's good at Go.
	
(@ex-believe-love-not) a. Jo didn't demonstrate that she's good at Go. <br>
	b. Jo doesn't love that she's good at Go.

(@ex-indef-def) a. Bo brought a dog to his place of work. <br>
	b. Bo brought the dog to his place of work.
	
(@ex-indef-def-not) a. Bo didn't bring a dog to his place of work. <br>
	b. Bo didn't bring the dog to his place of work.

## The question test

(@ex-believe-love-q) a. Did Jo demonstrate that she's good at Go?
	b. Does Jo love that she's good at Go?
	
(@ex-indef-def-q) a. Did Jo bring a dog to his place of work? <br>
	b. Did Jo bring the dog to his place of work?

## The conditional test

(@ex-believe-love-cond) a. If Jo demonstrated that she's good at Go, she'll have to join the Go league. <br>
	b. If Jo loves that she's good at Go, she'll have to join the Go league.

(@ex-indef-def-cond) a. If Bo brought a dog to his place of work, the boss will be mad. <br>
	b. If Bo brought the dog to his place of work, the boss will be mad.
