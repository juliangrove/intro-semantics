# Speaker meaning

## Overview

Things we've looked at:

- **Things that people do**:
  use expressions of their language to create certain (conventional) social effects.
  - Categorization of illocutionary effects:
	- performative, assertion, question, ...

::: {.fragment}
Things we *haven't* looked at:

- **How they do it**:
  how do we get from locutionary act to illocutionary act?
:::

## General strategy

What we need:

- a (systematic, predictive, comprehensive) story about how people use expressions to perform illocutionary acts

::: {.fragment}
We can work backwards.

- Illocutionary act [↓]{.gb-blue}
  - [Locutionary act]{.gb-blue}
	- syntax
	- semantics
