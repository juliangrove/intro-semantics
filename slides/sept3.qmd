# Speech acts (cont'd)

## Last time

How @austin_how_1962 classifies speech acts:

- as **locutionary acts**
- in terms of their **illocutionary effects**
- in terms of their **perlocutionary effects**
 
::: {.fragment}
Some examples:

## Peformatives (cont'd)

(@ex-apology) I [apologize]{.underline}.
	- apology
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">apology accepted</span>

(@ex-marriage) I do.
	- illocutionary act: vow
	- uptake: <span class="fragment">obligation registered</span>
	
(@ex-bet) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- illocutionary act: bet
	- uptake: bet accepted

## Felicity conditions

You can't just perform any speech act haphazardly.

## Felicity conditions

(@ex-apology) I apologize.
	- The speaker should have done something that requires an apology.
	
(@ex-marriage) I do.
	- There should be a vow at stake ("...till death do us part?").
	
(@ex-command) Open the window!
	- The utterer should have the relevant authority.


(@ex-bet) I bet you $300 that it will rain tomorrow.
	- The utterer should have the means to procure $300.

## Felicity conditions

In general:

- It must be allowable, by convention, for the speech act to have the illocutionary effect that it is intended to have.
- The circumstances prior to the act have to be appropriate.

## Performatives redux

Question 1

- What do performatives and other speech acts have in common?

::: {.fragment}
Question 2

- How does illocutionary effect fit into the distinction of @grice_meaning_1957 between meaning$_{NN}$ and meaning$_{N}$?
:::

---

## More on felicity conditions

- Performatives tend to have felicity conditions.
- What about other types of speech act?

(@ex-lights) Jo: Is Pascal's closed? <br> Bo: The lights are out.
	- Implies there are lights.
	- (May also imply that Pascal's is closed.)

---

## Presupposition

A well-studied type of felicity condition on speech acts.

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Apparently affects them uniformly.
:::

(@ex-lights-q) Are the lights are out?

(@ex-lights-imp) Turn out the lights!

::: {.fragment}
Both imply that there are lights.
