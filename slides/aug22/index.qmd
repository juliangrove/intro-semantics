## Some examples

(From the Corpus of Contemporary American English)

- "And they say, But she's completely herself. There's no **bullshit**, she knows what she wants. She's like a heat-seeking missile." (LA Times, 2017)

- "...I won't testify against you." I said, "**Bullshit**, Kate, you've got nothing to testify about." (SanFranChron, 1995)

- "And indeed, there are those folks who think the Oscars are total **bullshit**. They consider the award to be the real-life equivalent to the Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence" (Salon, 2016)
