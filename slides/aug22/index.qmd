"Twin Earth is very much like Earth: in fact, people on Twin Earth even speak English." [@putnam_meaning_1973]

## Meaning as distribution

"To the extent that formal (distributional) structure  can be discovered in discourse, it correlates in some way with the substance of what is being said..." [@harris_distributional_1954]

- The meaning of a linguistic expression can be understood as (some representation of) the contexts in which it occurs.
  - E.g., *dog* ≈ *cat*

# On "bullshit"

## Some examples

(From the Corpus of Contemporary American English)

- "And they say, But she's completely herself. There's no **bullshit**, she knows what she wants. She's like a heat-seeking missile." (LA Times, 2017)

- "...I won't testify against you." I said, "**Bullshit**, Kate, you've got nothing to testify about." (SanFranChron, 1995)

- "And indeed, there are those folks who think the Oscars are total **bullshit**. They consider the award to be the real-life equivalent to the Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence" (Salon, 2016)

## What is bullshit?

- Lying?
- Saying things that are false?

## A bullshit anecdote

Related by Fania Pascal [@frankfurt_bullshit_1986]:

*I had my tonsils out and was in the Evelyn Nursing Home feeling sorry for myself.
Wittgenstein called.
I croaked:
"I feel just  like a dog that has been run over."
He was disgusted:
"You don't know what a dog that has been run over feels like."*

## @frankfurt_bullshit_1986

*For the essence of bullshit is not that it is false but that it is phony.
In order to appreciate this distinction, one must recognize that a fake or a phony need not be in any respect (apart from authenticity itself) inferior to the real thing.
What is not genuine need not also be defective in some other way.
It may be, after all, an exact copy.
What is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.
This points to a similar and fundamental aspect of the essential nature of bullshit:
although it is produced without concern with the truth, it need not be false.
The bullshitter is faking things.
But this does not mean that he necessarily gets them wrong.*

## ChatGPT

- OpenAI chatbot based on the G(enerative) P(re-trained) T(ransformer) models.

---

## @hicks_chatgpt_2024

- **Bullshit (general):**
  Any utterance produced where a speaker has indifference towards the truth of the utterance.
- **Hard bullshit:**
  Bullshit produced with the intention to mislead the audience about the utterer’s agenda.
- **Soft bullshit:**
  Bullshit produced without the intention to mislead the hearer regarding the utterer’s agenda.

---

## "Hallucinations"

- @hicks_chatgpt_2024 argue that ChatGPT does not hallucinate.
  - Hallucination involves a non-standard perceptual experience, despite well-designed perceptual equipment.
