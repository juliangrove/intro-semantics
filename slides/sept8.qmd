# Speaker meaning (continued)

## Last time

Grice's maxims:
Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Manner.

- Quality:
  be truthful.
- Quantity:
  say enough (and not too much).
- Relation:
  be relevant.
- Manner:
  be brief, unambiguous, orderly, clear.

---

## Reasoning through some examples

(@ex-quantity) Jo did some of the readings.

- **Quantity implicature**: Jo did not do all of the readings.

::: {.fragment}
Reasoning:

::: {.smaller}
> - Speaker is being truthful (Quality) and providing as much information as required (Quantity).
> - Therefore: if they thought that Jo did all of the readings, they would say so.
> - They didn't say so, so Jo must not have done all of the readings.

## Reasoning through some examples

(@ex-relation) [**Context**: Jo is writing a letter of recommendation for Bo's linguistics instructor application.]{.smaller} <br>
	<span class="fragment">[**Jo**: To whom it may concern: Bo has great handwriting. He's quite punctual. He kicked my ass at Hungry Hungry Hippos]{.smaller}.</span>
	
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .smaller}
- **Implicature**: You should not hire Bo.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .fragment .smaller}
Reasoning:
:::

::::

::: {.smaller}
> - Jo typically provides truthful (Quality) and relevant information (Relation).
> - She has obviously flouted Relation.
> - So, satisfying both must require violating some other principle.

## Implicature

Two kinds typically recognized.

- Implicatures from the maxims:
  **conversational implicatures**.
  
- Another category of implicature:
  **conventional implicatures**.
  (@ex-but) The class is fun but difficult.
  (@ex-nom-appos) Jo, a linguist, enjoys syntax.
  (@ex-which) The instructor, who is a linguist, enjoys syntax.

---

## Conversational vs. conventional

Conversational implicatures:

- **Non-detachable** [@grice_logic_1975].
  (@ex-non-detachable) {Some, a few, several, many} linguists like syntax.
- Context-dependent.
  - Especially, **particularized** conversational implicatures.
  - @grice_logic_1975 distinguishes these from **generalized** conversational impicatures.			

---

## Conversational vs. conventional

Conventional implicatures:

- Generally, **detachable**.
  (@ex-detachable) The class is fun {but, and} difficult.
- Generally, not context-dependent.
  - Arise from particular lexical items and syntactic constructions.

---

## Detachability?

Examples from @coppock_superlative_2016:

(@ex-more) I'm in my sixties and had more than two parents growing up.

<br>

(@ex-at-least) I'm in my sixties and had at least three parents growing up.

# Some issues

## Issue: how to evaluate the maxims?

Quantity:
give the right amount of information.

- How much is enough/too much?

::: {.fragment}
Relation:
be relevant.

- Relevant to what?
:::

---

## Issue: the symmetry problem

(@ex-quantity) Jo did some of the readings.
- **Quantity implicature**: Jo didn't do all of the readings.
- But why not: Jo didn't do *only* some of the readings?

::: {.fragment}
What we need:
some notion of "possible alternative".
:::

---

## Questions under discussion

Asking a question:
add the question onto an ongoing record of questions that need to be answered.

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Discourse---at least involving assertions---always has the goal of answering some question [@roberts_information_2012].

- There is always a Question Under Discussion (QUD).
:::

---

## Example from last class

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}

::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-relation) **Context**: Jo and Bo are outside Pascal's, looking in the window. <br> 
	**Jo**: No one's at the cash register. <br>
	**Bo**: The lights are on.
:::

::: {.fragment}
QUD?

- Is Pascal's open?
:::

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/pascals.jpg){width="300px" height="400px"}
:::

::::

---

## Does this help with evaluating the maxims?

::: {.fragment}
Relation:

- Help resolve the QUD.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Quantity (Part 1):

- Resolve it as much as possible.
:::

---

## On the right track?

(@ex-quantity-qud) **Jo**: How many cookies did Mary eat? <br>
	**Bo**: Mary ate some of the cookies.
	
::: {.fragment}
::: {.nonincremental}
(@ex-no-quantity-qud) **Jo**: Is there any evidence against them? <br>
	**Bo**: Some of their identity documents are forgeries.
:::
	
(Based on example from @levinson_presumptive_2000.)
:::

---

## Dealing with the symmetry problem

Possibility:
certain lexical items are associated with *scales* [@horn_semantic_1972].

- none < some < all, every
- one < two < three
- decent < great < fantastic!

::: {.fragment}
How might this help with the symmetry problem?
